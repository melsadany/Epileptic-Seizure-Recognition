Epilepsy is a neurological disease that involves irregular actions, impulses, and lack of consciousness in some cases. Seizures, which are periods with irregular patterns of brain activity, are caused by this. To have successful instantaneous care and reduce the risk of damage, early diagnosis or identification of epileptic seizures is crucial. This has become an active research field, fueled by the growing affordability of EEG capture devices and the rapid growth of algorithms for machine learning. This report provides a thorough comparison of two classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). Such approaches have been compared to different used algorithms in literature based on their accuracy, f1 score, and interpretability. The study results show that RF and SVM can both be used for this problem domain. Although SVM and RF have nearly the same accuracy, it is recommended to use the RF model for further analysis because of its higher interpretability.

To run a demo, please use the coding files in the SRC folder and make sure that the data csv files are in the same folder. If you changed the data path, make sure to change the path in the coding file to retrieve your intended data. You can find the code of each model in a separate folder in the SRC directory with separate data files to avoid running errors on the data retrieval command line. 
Please follow the same coding lines to get the same results mentioned in the report & the excel file attached.
Just notice that there are some command lines commented in the coding files that can give you an intended output. 
The data file of 5-classes dataset is named data.csv and the 2-classes dataset is named data2.csv in both the SVM model and RF model folders. 
For the RF model, kindly note that you have to comment & uncomment the normalization lines to exchange between them 
Make sure to get back to the report to know the functions used and the output of each model.
